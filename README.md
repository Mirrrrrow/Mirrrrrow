  <summary>🔥 My Start into Coding</summary>
  When I was 10 years old the normal Minecraft wasnt enough for me, so I decided to code Scripts. (I have made like 100 Hub-Systems)
  So I have searched trough the internet and I found that i need to learn Java.
  So I learned it for like 1 Year and then i began to apply for teams. (Because I was so young not everyone accepted me)
  I was coding Java only for arround 2 Years (10 y/o -> 12/0).
  After that I decided to begin with SQL but my skills with this new "thing" weren't really good.
  But I continued to learn and learn.
  When I was 13 (exactly the 01.10.2021) I began to code in Lua with FiveM. I progressed really fast and good and SQL was nothing complicated for me.
  I've also learned the Basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for implementing GUI's into FiveM.
